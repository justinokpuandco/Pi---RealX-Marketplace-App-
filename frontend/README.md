# Pi Demo App Frontend

Pi Demo App is an example React app created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### 1. Install dependencies:

You will need a working NodeJS installation, and `yarn`. **The demo app frontend isn't meant to support npm**.
In most cases, `yarn` will come along with your NodeJS installation.

Install dependencies by running `yarn install`.

### 2. Start the app:

Run the following command to start the app's development server: `yarn start`
This will open a browser window on http://localhost:3314 which you can close, since the demo app mostly needs
to run inside of the Pi Sandbox environment in order to work correctly in development.

You've completed the frontend setup, return to [`doc/development.md`](../doc/development.md) to finish setting up the demo app
